Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Flash memory is another form of semiconductor memory. 
   **True**

2. MMU stands for: 
   **Memory Management Unit**

3. SRAM requires the supporting refresh circuitry.
   **False** (SRAM does not require refresh circuitry, unlike DRAM)

4. _______ is the rate at which data can be transferred into or out of a memory unit.
   **Transfer rate**

5. Address length of a 16-Mbit (4M x 4) DRAM is _______.
   **22 bit** (Address length is calculated as log2(memory size / word size), here log2(4M))

6. Memory is organized into units of data, called ______.
   **Blocks**

7. A physical cache, also known as a virtual cache.
   **False** (Physical and virtual caches are different concepts)

8. Faster access time, smaller cost per bit.
   **False** (Generally, faster access time comes with a higher cost per bit)

9. SRAM is made with cells that store data as charge on capacitors.
   **False** (This describes DRAM, not SRAM)

10. In which type of memory data is actually wired into the chip as part of the fabrication process.
    **ROM**

11. What will be the length of the address line of the 24x8 bit RAM Chip?
    **Five bit** (24 addresses, log2(24) â‰ˆ 4.58, rounded up to 5 bits)

12. In some systems, the addressable unit is called _____.
    **The word**

13. The _______ is equal to the number of electrical lines into and out of the memory module.
    **Bandwidth**

14. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is a digital device that uses the same logic elements used in the processor.
    **False** (DRAM uses different principles for storing data compared to processor logic elements)

15. ________ mapping technique maps each block of main memory into only one possible cache line.
    **Direct**

16. Greater capacity, slower access time.
    **True** (Generally, memory with greater capacity has a slower access time)

17. A dynamic memory cell is simpler and smaller than a static memory cell.
    **True** (Dynamic memory cells are typically simpler and smaller than static ones)

18. Associative memory is a random access type of memory.
    **False** (Associative memory is searched based on content rather than specific addresses)

19. In which type of memory binary values are stored using traditional flip-flop logic gate.
    **SRAM**

20. SRAM is used as cache memory.
    **True** (SRAM is commonly used for cache memory due to its speed)
